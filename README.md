# FluidSimulation
This project implements a 2D fluid simulation using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) principles in C++ with SFML. The simulation showcases fluid particle interactions based on physical properties like density, pressure, and velocity, offering a realistic representation of fluid behavior.
